Fedora Red Team working copy of PTES

## Why?

The [pentest-standard.org](http://pentest-standard.org) site is pretty great, but it's a little dated, and the way in which to make contributions is murky. This repo is an effort to redesign the site around GitHub and [Read The Docs](https://readthedocs.org/).
